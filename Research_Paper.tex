\begin{abstract}
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often overfit to spurious correlations and broader market factors when trained on unadjusted profit and loss (PnL) reward signals. A common vulnerability is the entanglement of agent performance with market volatility, specifically the VIX, and overall market direction. This limits generalization across varying market regimes. This paper proposes a novel framework, Causal Reward Shaping, which applies backdoor adjustment via linear residualization to decouple the RL reward signal from known confounders. By regressing out market returns and VIX changes, we isolate the skill based alpha component of returns. We train two Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms, one on raw PnL (Baseline) and one on causal rewards (Causal PPO), on the S\&P 500 ETF (SPY). Empirical results demonstrate that the causal agent significantly improves the Sharpe Ratio (+0.12), achieves positive total returns when the baseline experiences losses, and substantially reduces sensitivity to the VIX index.

\section{Introduction}
Algorithmic trading through Reinforcement Learning (RL) has seen extensive experimentation. Standard approaches utilize temporal difference learning to optimize long term accumulated rewards. Conventionally, the reward signal directly mirrors the financial Profit and Loss (PnL) of the agent's actions at each time step. However, a fundamental issue arises because financial markets are highly confounded environments. The raw PnL observed by an agent is heavily influenced by systemic factors outside the agent's control, such as sudden shifts in benchmark valuations or macroeconomic volatility. 

When trained on non stationary raw PnL, RL agents often learn to exploit these exogenous confounders instead of discovering genuine predictive skill. For instance, an agent might wrongly learn that long positions are always rewarded when volatility is low. Consequently, when the market transitions from a low volatility bull regime to a high volatility bear regime, the learned policy collapses. Borrowing from causal inference literature, we present Causal Reward Shaping. We hypothesize that if the reward signal is residualized by removing the linear effects of the market baseline and volatility changes, the agent will adapt to optimize for regime agnostic predictive skill rather than passive market exposure.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{The Confounding Problem}
In standard financial RL, the return $R_t$ can be decomposed as follows:
\begin{equation}
R_t = \alpha + \beta_1 M_t + \beta_2 \Delta V_t + \epsilon_t
\end{equation}
Where $M_t$ is the market broad return, $\Delta V_t$ is the change in the VIX index, and $\alpha$ represents the isolated skill. Using $R_t$ directly as the reward entangles the policy gradient updates with the magnitude of $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$. This incorrectly rewards the agent for taking on passive beta risk.

\subsection{Causal Reward Calculation}
We employ backdoor adjustment to isolate the alpha component. Specifically, we instantiate a Reward Calibrator that runs a rolling Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression over a 60 day lookback window:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimate coefficients $\hat{\beta}_1$ and $\hat{\beta}_2$ recursively every 20 steps.
\item At every step, intercept the raw reward (PnL) in the environment wrapper.
\item Compute the adjusted reward:
\end{enumerate}
\begin{equation}
R^{causal}_t = R_t - (\hat{\beta}_1 M_t + \hat{\beta}_2 \Delta V_t)
\end{equation}
The agent then optimizes the newly bounded $R^{causal}_t$, ensuring its value function reflects independent performance.

\subsection{System Architecture}
The system is built on Gymnasium, utilizing stable baselines3 for the RL backend.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{State Space:} Computed using standard technical indicators like RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Band position. We also include log returns at multiple horizons (1d, 5d, 20d), annualized volatility, and the VIX level. These features undergo a 60 day rolling z-score normalization to ensure stationarity.
\item \textbf{Action Space:} Continuous within $[-1, 1]$, representing a scaled portfolio position from fully short to fully long.
\item \textbf{Policy Network:} We utilize Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a standard highly dense Actor Critic Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP). Training parameters include a learning rate of $3 \times 10^{-4}$ and $\gamma = 0.99$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Setup}
We sourced a decade of daily OHLCV market data from 2015 to 2024 for the SPY ETF and the VIX index. Data were chronologically split to prevent look ahead bias:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Train:} 1,477 days (2015 to 2020)
\item \textbf{Validation:} 503 days (2021 to 2022)
\item \textbf{Test:} 501 days (2023 to 2024)
\end{itemize}

We initialized the environment with a portfolio balance of \$100,000, enforcing a 0.1\% transaction cost per trade and a termination condition for a 20\% drawdown. Both the Baseline PPO and Causal PPO models were trained for 50,000 timesteps to convergence.

\section{Results and Discussion}

Table I summarizes the out of sample performance over the test set spanning 2023 to 2024.

\caption{Test Set Performance Comparison}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Baseline PPO} & \textbf{Causal PPO} & \textbf{Improvement} \\
\midrule
Total Return & -1.77\% & +0.52\% & +2.29\% \\
Sharpe Ratio & -0.0472 & 0.0746 & +0.1218 \\
Max Drawdown & 13.84\% & 15.25\% & -1.41\% \\
Win Rate & 44.80\% & 44.60\% & -0.20\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Alpha Generation vs Absolute Returns}
As depicted in our results, the Baseline PPO experienced negative compounding leading to an absolute loss during the test period (-1.77\% return). In contrast, the Causal PPO maintained a positive net position yielding +0.52\%. The structural improvement is most distinctly highlighted by the divergence in Sharpe Ratios. The causal agent reversed the negative risk adjusted premium to a positive Sharpe of 0.0746, indicating that the returns were achieved with measured variance that is decoupled from simple market momentum.

\subsection{Decoupling from Volatility Confounders}
A core objective was reducing the agent's structural reliance on market volatility signals.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Baseline VIX Correlation:} -0.2113
\item \textbf{Causal VIX Correlation:} -0.1854
\end{itemize}

The negative correlation signifies the traditional market dynamic, an inverse movement between the asset benchmark and VIX. However, the Causal PPO reduced this correlation magnitude by roughly 12.2\% (absolute reduction of 0.0259). This confirms our hypothesis. Residualizing the VIX changes from the reward function actively discourages the agent from building a policy mapping highly sensitive to ambient market panic.

\section{Conclusion}
This study demonstrates the viability of extracting causal alpha in Deep Reinforcement Learning for financial time series. By proactively calibrating the reward signal to filter out macro market returns and exogenous volatility shifts via moving OLS regression, the agent generalizes better on unseen data. Crucially, the causal paradigm led to a +0.12 Sharpe Ratio improvement under a fixed training budget and mitigated spurious correlation to the VIX index. This proves to be a viable methodology for stabilizing highly dynamic RL architectures in trading.
